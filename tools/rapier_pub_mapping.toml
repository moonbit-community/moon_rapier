# Mapping from Rapier rustdoc item paths to MoonBit symbols.
#
# Purpose:
# - Rapier pub surface is audited from rustdoc JSON for rapier2d/rapier3d v0.32.0
#   (default features only).
# - MoonBit export surface is audited from */pkg.generated.mbti and */spec.mbt.
# - API names do NOT need to match. This file lets us declare equivalences so the
#   audit can focus on remaining semantic gaps.
#
# Notes:
# - Keys MUST be quoted (they contain ::).
# - Values are either a single quoted string or an array of quoted strings.
# - Symbols are free-form, but we recommend: "<moonbit package>::<Type>::<method>"
#
# Examples:
# [map]
# "rapier2d::pipeline::PhysicsPipeline::step" = "Milky2018/moon_rapier/pipeline::PhysicsPipeline::step"
# "rapier3d::prelude::RigidBodySet" = [
#   "Milky2018/moon_rapier/dynamics::RigidBodySet3D",
#   "Milky2018/moon_rapier/dynamics::RigidBodySet3DReal",
# ]
#
# For items we explicitly do not want to track (e.g. Rust ecosystem re-exports),
# list them under [ignore] with a short reason string.
